Hello, there! Allow me to introduce myself: I’m **Jordan Mershimer**, a dedicated and passionate _Chemist and Biochemist_, with an affinity for _Physics_, and a knack for _Python programming and IT troubleshooting_. My education and work experience have uniquely positioned me at the exciting intersection of **science, data, and technology**.

With a bachelor’s degree in _Chemistry and Biochemistry_ from the distinctive [Warren Wilson College](https://www.warren-wilson.edu/), my academic journey was a blend of rigorous academics, practical work, and service. This was where I delved deep into **catalyst design and environmental testing** and had the privilege of presenting my undergraduate research on high-performance Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) catalysts. By utilizing machine learning methods, I was able to screen potential catalysts, demonstrating my interest and proficiency in harnessing the power of data.

However, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. My hands-on approach extends beyond academia into my professional life. I've honed my skills in optimizing lab operations, mentoring students, digitizing extensive land monitoring archives, and playing key roles in field research and data analysis. From my time as a Lab Assistant and Tutor at Warren Wilson to my tenure as a Land Steward Intern at [Mainspring Conservation Land Trust](https://www.mainspringconserves.org/), my journey has been a blend of scientific discovery and technical expertise.

What sets me apart is my ability to **effectively communicate complex scientific concepts** and **collaborate seamlessly** in team environments. I’m an avid believer in the power of communication and cooperation in driving success and innovation.

Outside the professional sphere, I love pushing my limits, both physically and mentally. As a _powerlifter_ and _CrossFit athlete_, I constantly strive to achieve and surpass my personal bests. The discipline, perseverance, and tenacity I have developed through sports permeate all areas of my life, including my work.

Through this blog, I aim to share my unique blend of skills, insights, and experiences with like-minded individuals and those interested in the dynamic world of **science, data, and technology**. Whether you’re a fellow scientist, a data enthusiast, an aspiring student, or just someone with a curious mind, I hope you find something here that resonates with you.

_Welcome to my blog!_
