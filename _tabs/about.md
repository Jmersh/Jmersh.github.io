# About Me

Hello, there! Allow me to introduce myself: I'm **Jordan Mershimer**, a Research Engineer and Project Manager specializing in **sustainable battery technology**. My journey began as a *Chemist and Biochemist*, and has evolved to combine scientific expertise with engineering innovation and project leadership. With a strong foundation in *Physics* and proficiency in *Python programming, PLC systems, and engineering design*, I work at the fascinating intersection of **science, sustainability, and technology**.

## Academic Background

With a bachelor's degree in *Chemistry and Biochemistry* from the distinctive Warren Wilson College, my academic journey was a blend of rigorous academics, practical work, and service. This was where I first explored **catalyst design and environmental testing** and had the privilege of presenting my undergraduate research on high-performance Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) catalysts. By utilizing machine learning methods, I demonstrated early on my ability to harness the power of data for scientific discovery.

## Professional Journey

In my current role as a Project Manager and Research Engineer, I lead innovative initiatives in battery recycling and sustainable technology. My work combines scientific expertise with engineering innovation – from designing automated systems with PLC controls to integrating complex mechanical and electrical components. I thrive on turning innovative concepts into practical solutions that contribute to a more sustainable future.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and practical implementation. Whether I'm developing new recycling processes, optimizing automation systems, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I believe in the power of clear communication and strategic thinking to drive innovation forward.

## Beyond Work

Outside the professional sphere, I maintain a diverse range of interests. You might find me on the tennis or pickleball court, or testing my problem-solving skills at the local bouldering gym. 

I'm also an avid reader, constantly exploring the intersections of:
* Business
* Psychology
* Philosophy
* Science fiction
* Fantasy
* Classical literature

I'm particularly fascinated by Vernor Vinge's work and his concept of the technological singularity – a testament to my enduring interest in the future of technology and its implications for humanity. These varied pursuits not only keep me physically and mentally active but also provide fresh perspectives that enhance my approach to engineering challenges and project management.
